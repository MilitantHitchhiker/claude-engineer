Updated Usage Instructions:

1. Setup:
   - Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system.
   - Navigate to the project directory (multi_agent_scraper).
   - Install the required dependencies by running:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. Running the scraper:
   - To start the scraper with default settings, run:
     ```
     python main.py
     ```
   - To specify custom options, use the following command-line arguments:
     ```
     python main.py [-h] [-q QUERIES [QUERIES ...]] [-n NUM_AGENTS] [-o OUTPUT] [-m MAX_RESULTS]
     ```

     Arguments:
     - `-h`, `--help`: Show help message and exit
     - `-q QUERIES [QUERIES ...]`, `--queries QUERIES [QUERIES ...]`: List of search queries to process
     - `-n NUM_AGENTS`, `--num-agents NUM_AGENTS`: Number of scraper agents to use
     - `-o OUTPUT`, `--output OUTPUT`: Output file name for search results
     - `-m MAX_RESULTS`, `--max-results MAX_RESULTS`: Maximum number of results per query

   Examples:
   - Run with custom queries:
     ```
     python main.py -q "artificial intelligence" "machine learning"
     ```
   - Run with 10 agents and max 20 results per query:
     ```
     python main.py -n 10 -m 20
     ```
   - Specify a custom output file:
     ```
     python main.py -o my_results.json
     ```

3. Output:
   - Results will be saved to the specified output file (default: `search_results.json`).
   - The results file will contain a JSON object with search queries as keys and lists of search results as values.

4. Customization:
   - You can still modify the `config.py` file to change default settings.
   - The command-line arguments will override the default settings when specified.

5. Troubleshooting:
   - If you encounter any issues, check the console output for error messages or warnings.
   - Ensure you have a stable internet connection.
   - If you face rate limiting issues, try reducing the number of agents or increasing the `REQUEST_DELAY` in `config.py`.

The multi-agent web scraper is now fully operational with CLI support, allowing for easy customization of search queries, number of agents, and other parameters without modifying the config file. Users can run the scraper with default settings or specify custom options through command-line arguments.
Certainly! Let's finalize the project by updating the `scraper.py` file to accept the `max_results` parameter and then provide updated usage instructions.

First, let's update the `scraper.py` file:Certainly! Let's finalize the project by updating the `scraper.py` file to accept the `max_results` parameter and use it when filtering results. Here's the updated `scraper.py`:Great! Now that we've made these final adjustments, our multi-agent web scraper is complete and fully operational with CLI support. Let's summarize the changes and provide updated usage instructions:

Summary of changes:
1. We created a new `cli.py` file to handle command-line argument parsing.
2. We updated `main.py` to use the CLI arguments and pass them to the Scraper.
3. We modified `scraper.py` to accept a `max_results` parameter and use it when filtering results.
